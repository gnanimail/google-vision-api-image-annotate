# google-vision-api

This repository includes code originally written during the [Archives Unleashed Hackathon](https://artsweb.uwaterloo.ca/archivesunleashed/) (March 3-5, 2016). 

The "google-vision-api.py" is a command-line tool to work with the Vision API.

```
$ python google-vision-api.py [images]
```

## Google Cloud Vision API

The [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/) beta was released earlier this month (I received an email on the beta release on March 01, 2016). The API currently allows for label detection, text detection, and face detection among [many others](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/concepts). 

### Setting Up

1. You'll need a Google Developers account to create the API keys and to take care of other authentication details. Google's documentation for setting up this API is [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/getting-started). This is enough to get set up on your local machine.

Don't forget to set up your credentials for the CLI to work:

  ```
  $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_service_account_file>

  $ echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  ```

2. For the Python script, the [Label Detection Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/label-tutorial) is a good start. You'll need to run a few "pip install" commands for "google-api-python-client", "oauth2client".

	```
	$ pip install apiclient
	$ pip install oauth2client
	$ pip install httplib2
	```

3. Run the script. You can have a folder of images you'd like to call the API on or use individual images.

	```
	$ python google-vision-api.py images/
	$ python google-vision-api.py dog.jpg
	```

4. Specifiy features you'd like to query. The body portion of the service_request variable can be adjusted to include other data you'd like to get. Currently only label detection and text detection are included in this script but the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/concepts) includes more.

	```
	LABEL_DETECTION	Execute Image Content Analysis on the entire image and return
	TEXT_DETECTION	Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on text within the image
	FACE_DETECTION	Detect faces within the image
	LANDMARK_DETECTION	Detect geographic landmarks within the image
	LOGO_DETECTION	Detect company logos within the image
	SAFE_SEARCH_DETECTION	Determine image safe search properties on the image
	IMAGE_PROPERTIES	Compute a set of properties about the image (such as the image's dominant colors)
	```

### Samples

The "Getting Started" tutorial provides a dog.jpg image to run in the first API call. 

![dog.jpg](/images/dog.jpg?raw=true)

It works as intended and correctly identifies the image as a dog. Extending the maxResults returns even more results as follows.
```

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
